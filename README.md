# Team1Project

This is the final project our group chose to make. It is supposed to be an all in one platform for students and teachers. We chose this because we had all experienced at some point throughout the course that it was unclear where to find certain things. Our must have list from the start was quite simple, we wanted to have a site where students could view their schedule, contact teachers and other students, upload their assignments, connect to a digital classroom and find important news. Teachers should also be able to edit the schedule, post new information and grade students work. 

We weren't able to finish everything but we got a good base going. Everyone in the group contributed to the code equally and we helped eachother out, so we all worked a bit on everything, more specifically what I contributed was almost all of the CSS, some HTML, JS and Java.
